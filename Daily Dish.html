<h1 style="color:blueviolet"> My Indigenous Culture </h1>

<p>My name is Sanik Edwards, and I take great pride in sharing my Indigenous heritage and the rich experiences that shaped my upbringing.</p>

<p><p style="font-size:100%;">I was a fancy shawl dancer, and I proudly wore two princess crowns.
    The women’s fancy shawl dance represents a butterfly coming out of its cocoon. The shawl is often the most colorful and eye-catching part of the outfit, featuring bright designs and decorations like embroidery or ribbon work. The fringe on the shawl moves with the dancer.</p>

<p>Additionally, I was the drum leader of an all-female powwow drum, a role that showcased my leadership and dedication to our culture.
    My passion for singing was nurtured by my parents, who instilled in me a deep appreciation for music from a young age. I cherish the memories of my father’s powerful voice, and I’m excited to share a link to his heartfelt rendition of a handrum warrior song. His performance captures the spirit and strength of the culture, and it resonates with me every time I listen to it.
